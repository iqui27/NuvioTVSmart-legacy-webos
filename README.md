## Get Nuvio TV

Nuvio TV supports **Samsung Tizen TVs from 2018 onward (Tizen 4+)** and **LG webOS TVs from 2020 onward (webOS 5+)**.
On Tizen 4, some advanced audio/subtitle features may be limited, and torrent/P2P playback is unavailable by design.
On Tizen 5+ and LG webOS, torrent/P2P uses only the bundled local companion service; no external torrent streaming server is configured or required.

- [Nuvio TV Installer](https://github.com/NuvioMedia/NuvioTVSmart-Installer/releases/latest) for Windows, macOS, and Linux
- [Samsung Tizen WGT](https://github.com/NuvioMedia/NuvioWeb/releases/latest) for manual installation
- [LG webOS Homebrew repository](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NuvioMedia/NuvioTVWebOS/main/webosbrew/apps.json)
- [LG webOS IPK](https://github.com/NuvioMedia/NuvioWeb/releases/latest) for manual installation

## Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NuvioMedia/NuvioWeb.git NuvioTVSmart
cd NuvioTVSmart
npm install
npm run build
```

Build TV packages with:

```bash
npm run package:tizen
npm run package:tizen:store
npm run package:webos
```

`package:tizen` creates the unsigned WGT used by development and the Nuvio TV Installer. The installer signs it locally for the target TV before installation. `package:tizen:store` is a separate Seller Office build: it requires Tizen Studio/Web CLI and a configured security profile, and creates the signed Store package with the local EngineFS service included so Tizen 5+ retains torrent/P2P playback. Tizen 4 still reports P2P as unsupported at runtime. Nuvio TV is built with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and platform TV APIs. Building requires Node.js and npm; package installation additionally requires the relevant Tizen or webOS tools.
